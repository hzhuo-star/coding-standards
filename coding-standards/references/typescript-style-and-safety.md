## TypeScript style and safety

Use strict TypeScript settings where practical:

- `strict: true`
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`
- `noImplicitOverride: true`
- `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch: true`

Prefer immutable values:

```ts
type CreateUserInput = {
  readonly email: EmailAddress;
  readonly roles: ReadonlyArray<Role>;
};
```

Mutation is acceptable inside localized imperative shell code, performance-sensitive internals, builders, or adapters when hidden behind a precise interface.

### Casts, `any`, and non-null assertions

Avoid:

- `any`
- non-null assertions (`!`)
- casts with `as Type`

`as const` is fine.

Rare exceptions are allowed for highly generic helpers, branding internals, interop boundaries, or combinators where TypeScript cannot express the invariant.

Any non-`as const` cast requires a Rust-like safety comment:

```ts
// SAFETY: TypeScript cannot express the brand. parseEmailAddress checked the normalized string before branding. Callers cannot construct EmailAddress except through this parser.
return normalized as EmailAddress;
```

Rare `any` also requires a targeted oxlint ignore and justification:

```ts
// oxlint-disable-next-line no-explicit-any -- SAFETY: This helper preserves arbitrary function parameters; TypeScript cannot express this variadic constraint without any.
type Fn = (...args: any[]) => unknown;
```

Do not use `!`. Branch, parse, or refine instead.
